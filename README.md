# Problem Statement 
Incorporate blockchain to secure the flow of data in a ‘manufacturer - maintenance’ system.

This project aims to develop such a blockchain architecture and also highlight the salient features of the blockchain technology through this application.

# Required software  
1. Hyperledger Sawtooth - Python SDK (Software Developer Kit)
2. Visual studio 
3. OS - Ubuntu 16.04
